# FreedomLib
 A library of potentially useful code to try to make VBA code (now twinBasic code) more expressive and simpler to write.

 This library has its roots in a library I compiled during sessions of writing answer to Advent Of Code problems.

 The renaming to FreedomLib was the realisation that the library helped significantly in removing some of the shackles of VB/VBA code by 
 * enabling a greater scope of Type and Meta Type reflection (TypeInfo and Var classes),
 * a universal iterator (Class Iter),
 * a Matrix class that allows the item location to be specified via an array,
 * Enhanced Collection and Dictionary classes (Seq and Kvp classes)
 * Map functionality in Seq and Kvp classes
 * A universal comparer (byvalue, by Type and Value, by Metatype and value etc)
 * Strings with value interpolation and type insertion

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AT PRESENT AS CODE FOR SOME FUNCTIONALITY HAS NOT YET BEEN ADDED AS IT NEEDS TO BE CONVERTED TO PURE TWINBASIC
